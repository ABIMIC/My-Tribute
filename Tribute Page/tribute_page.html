He nurses an ambition of having conglomerates of companies by the name Abimic Group of Companies(AGOC) where he would function as the President of the Group. He has interest to float a fintech company whose name is only known to him, that would help ease transfer to banks locally and intrernationally, you earn points using our app, and it would majorly be virtual as you can complete all transaction like regular banks apps on it too.<br>

                <h2>Early Life</h2>
                He was born into the Abikale's Family, a family of two, just him and his younger sis. He was born in July 2nd, 1990 in Lagos, but had his schools till secondary in Ijebu Ode, Ogun State. He attended Happy Day Nursery and Primary School and graduated in the year 2000 before attending Adeola Odutola College in Ogun State and graduated 2006. While in Jss3, he nurtured the ambition of becoming either a petroleum engineer or a ship builder, for he loves the beauties of ships. He saw the reality of studying Petroleum Engineering was more possible due to funds. He gained admission into the University of Benin in 2009 to study Petroleum Engineering where he bagged Bachelor of Engineering Degree. God was faithful that while on this course as a student in the University, He was on full scholarship sponsored by Chevron as an Agbami Scholar.<br>
                <h2 id="NYSC">NYSC</h2>
                He was curious to be told his posting letter was available, so he returned to school to have his and to his dismay, he was posted to Yobe state, he looked sad, gloomy and unhappy. 2014 was a serious battle year for our Nigerian Army fighting insurgencies in the North. He was to be in batch b stream II due to unrest in NE, and he was to have his orientation camp in Abuja Camp at kubwa. Before he knows it, Ebola outbreak happened and their camping was cancelled, all needed to do was, to just report in camp for few days, and be reposted elsewhere for those who seek such interest. So he sought to be reposted to Delta, but he got anambra. They would be the first set of corpers ever to be brought back to camp after starting their service. He served in St Charles Secondary School in Lilu, Ihiala Local Government Area of Anambra State where he taught Physics, Further Maths and Basic Technology. He rounded off his service year in 2015 to return back to Lagos.<br>
                <h2 id="career">Career</h2>
                He started teaching in Honeyspring Schools at Fagba, Lagos where he taught Phsyics, Chemistry and Further Maths. He would be frank, Getting job as a fresh graduate into the Oil Industry was a dream too tall to achieve for him, because while he job hunted, he only attended a written test for an experienced role for a petroleum production engineer, he knew his chances were slim or not just there. He took a step of faith by going to companies to submit individually, it yielded no positives, as he got no reply till date. Then he remembered an oil company CEO once said while he was in school, build your connections, build your network, that is your lifelong support after here.  While teaching at honeyspring, he was pressing his phone, then he was on an app, he started imagining the technology behind this. This endeared him to software development. After leaving honeyspring, he moved to joining another school, Barachel Model College, then he now joined Globacom as a Customer Care Representative till date from 2016. In all of this, he has built personal experiences cut accross different techs, even though not professionally but it can lit up a room if required to prove it. He has built personal experiences cut across Software Development, like web development, web apps and even data analysis. He can coarse and crush data to draw out meaningful insights using the data analyis tools.
